Advanced Discord Music Bot, Using Lavalink.



## Running

I would prefer if you don't run an instance of my bot. Just call the join command with an invite URL to have it on your server. The source here is provided for discord verification.


Nevertheless, the installation steps are as follows:

1. **Make sure to get Python 3.8 or higher**
This is required to actually run the bot.

2. **Set up venv**
Just do `python -m venv venv`

3. **Install dependencies**
This is `pip install -U -r requirements.txt`

4. **Setup configuration**
The next step is just to fill the `config.py` file in `cogs/utils` folder

5. **Configuration of Database**
Run the commands within schema.sql inside the sql folder
