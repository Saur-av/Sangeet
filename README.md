# Sangeet

Music System for Discord Using LavaLink.



## Running

I would prefer if you don't run an instance of my bot. Just call the join command with an invite URL to have it on your server. The source here is provided for discord verification.


Nevertheless, the installation steps are as follows:

1. **Make sure to get Python 3.8 or higher**
This is required to actually run the bot.

2. **Set up venv**
Construct a Virtual Environment on the Projetc Folder
`python -m venv venv`

4. **Install dependencies**
Install dependencies in the Virtual Environment
`pip install -U -r requirements.txt`

6. **Setup configuration**
Goto `cogs/utils` folder, Update the `config.py` file.
